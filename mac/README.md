Workman keyboard layout for MacOS
===========

Workman and Workman-P Mac OSX keyboard layout packaged as a keylayout bundle includes alternate icons, similar in style to the system icons for other layouts like Dvorak or Colemak.

## Installation

 * Download the keyboard layout bundle to the /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ or ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ directory.
 * Log out of OS X and log back in.
 * Open System Preferences, click on the Language & Text icon, and in the Input Menu tab enable the Workman and/or Workman-P layout.
 * Make sure that the Show input menu in menu bar box is also checked.
 * To switch quickly between layouts you can press Command+Space or Command+Option+Space. Note, this hotkey combination conflicts with the default settings for showing Spotlight. Check your settings in System Preferences, Keyboard, Keyboard Shortcuts tab, Spotlight against Keyboard & Text Input.
