The Workman Layout is free to the public.
This means that there is no license, permission, or fee necessary to use or implement the layout itself (arrangement of keys), or the installation files that I released.
Use it, implement it, integrate it, create tools for it, etc. Have a go at it. You don’t need my permission to do so.

However, if you do use or implement the Workman Layout (i.e. arrangement of the keys) in some way or fashion, attribution to OJ Bucao as the creator is requested and a link back to this blog. This means that if you have an Workman Layout implementation/installation file that you created for some platform or OS, please put somewhere in the file something like the following:

Also if you use content from my blog or articles or quote me directly, please use proper citation .

Having said this, I am also retaining the rights to the name Workman.
As the author of the Workman Keyboard Layout, I am retaining the right to name what is officially to be called Workman.
This means that if you have an idea for a cool new keyboard layout, or decide to modify Workman into something else (i.e. not using the Workman Layout alphabetic arrangement), please name your layout differently unless you have my permission to do so.

You may however make variations of the Workman Layout that does not modify or change the alphabetic arrangement of the original and you may call it as some variation of the Workman Layout (e.g. Workman Layout wide mod, etc.)

The Workman Layout is provided with no warranty or guarantee of any kind.
